# Gamebook

Welcome to Gamebook! The site where gaming enthusiasts can share thoughts, tips, tricks and more about games!
This site is designed to be a social media platform aimed specifically at gamers. It is a place where the community can come together and share a huge amount of knowledge on any game. The platform would also appeal to gaming companies and content creators as a way to advatise and monitor the popularity of certain games. This makes it stand out from the huge crowd of different social media platforms that exist today, and this is only the begining! I truely believe thise site could be improved apon significantly to make it even better with some extra features that would help it to excel in a real world senerio.

## The Fontend

- While it is crusial that the back end is functional, the main focus for this project was the front end. Front end developers often focus on the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) to create an interactive and user friendly application. This is what I tried to accomplish in this project, using wireframes to translate my ideas into a responsive and functioning website.

## The Wireframe

These wireframe were some basic ideas of how I wanted my site to look. I waanted it to be clear and practical, so that the user can navigate easily. I thought about putting the popular profiles section at the top of the page just under the navbar but I really wanted users to be able to see the first post clearly when they opened the site. This would be more likely to draw people in. However I realised that this was perfect for smaller screen widths, as having two columns next to each other on a mobile device for example makes the content much too small.

- The wireframe for the home page:

![wireframe home page](/docs/wireframes/wfhome.jpg)

- The wrieframe for the post page. This is the page a user will see if they click on a post to view it individually:

![wireframe post page](/docs/wireframes//wfpost.jpg)

- The wireframe for the profile page: something I forgot to consider here at the time of planning was that if a user is signed in, and is viewing another users profile, they will also see the follow/ unfollow button for that profile.

## Design Features

- **Color Scheme:** 

The colour scheme for this site is red, white and a super dark blue thats almost black. When I started the project my first thought was: 'What colours do I think of when I think about gaming?' and red was immediately my first response. The colour red is used so much in the gaming industry because of its vibrant, exciting appearance to make games amoung other products look as fun and exciting as possible. My next choice was black as black and red is used a lot in games, gaming equipment is commonly black. However when I tried to use black I didn't like the outcome. If I used it as a background colour it made the site look very dark, and a lot of the images I was uploading just didn't stand out so well on a black background. The more I lightened the black colour to more of a gray the less clear the red text became. I ended up using white instead as it looked a lot more friendly and welcoming which is something I wanted for my social media platform to encourage people to use it. However when I was experimenting with different shades of black I found this very nice black/blue which I decided to use as a highlight for things like the navbar icons when hovered or active. It stands out very well and contrasts nicely from the other colours which is perfect for this role.

- **Font:** 

My font which I chose for this site is called Roboto Mono and I really like how it is clear and easy to read it is. It also looks like a font from a video game; it reminds me of a font from a retro game but with a modern twist. I ended up using this font for the whole site as I thought it worked so well with the theme and kept the site consistent in style.

## Structural Features

### The Navbar

- This contains the logo, nav-links. If the user is signed in there will also be a link to their profile and their avatar will be displayed.

- The logo can be clicked to naigate the user back to the home page.

- The nav-links have a darker colour when hovered or active.

![the sign-up page](/docs/screenshots/signup1.jpg)

### Sign-in Page

- The sign-in page is basically the same but the form only has one password field.

![the sign-in page](/docs/screenshots/signin1.jpg)

### Feed and Liked pages:

- When signed in the user can navigate to the 'Feed' and 'Liked' pages through the navbar. The feed shows the user posts made by accounts they are following.

![the feed](/docs/screenshots/feed1.jpg)

- Whilst the liked page is of course for posts the user has liked:

![the liked page](/docs/screenshots/liked1.jpg)

![the profile page](/docs/screenshots/profile1.jpg)

- If the user is signed in and viewing their own profile they will also see this dropdown menu allowing them to edit their profile, username or password. 

![profile dropdown menu](/docs/screenshots/profile2.jpg)

## Future Features

In the future I would love to include the following aspects to make the site compete with other big social media platforms:

- Private messaging -to allow direct communication between users

- Pin comments -to allow only the owner of a post to pin a comment to the top of the list. It could be one they thought was most useful like an answer to a question, or one they thought was simply the most funny. This would improve user experience as other people looking for an answer wouldn't have to scroll through all comments to find it.

- Reply to comments -being able to reply to a specific comment would make communication between users easier as the reply would be under the original comment and not above in order from newest to oldest. It would be easier to tell who was talking to who or responding to which comment.

- Like comments -being able to like comments is similar to being able to pin them, except its not just the owner of the post who can like its comments. Allowing all suers to like comments (provided that they are logged in) provides more overall user interaction for the community.

- Email authentication / password recovery -to allow users to reset their password if they forgot it would be ideal for real world use. Everyone forgets their password sometimes! It would encorage users to continue using the site instead of giving up or having to make a new account.

- Emojis for desktop -emojis are a huge part of how people express themselves online and would not only improve user experince but also just make posting and communiting with each other more fun!

- Notifications -recieving notifications when someone likes of comments on your post would also encorage users to return to the site often and boost user activity.

- Able to view followers/following -being able to see a list of followers or people you are following would make it easier to follow/unfollow speific people so the user doesn't have to scroll through the feed to try to find someone.

## Bugs

### Major Bug:

- Bug: On the **deployed** site from Heroku, the user cannot add a post, view a profile or comment on a post.

- Solution: **Unfixed**. I spent over an hour looking into this bug with a professional tutor and even with their help, experience and expertise we could not work out what was causing this. They even sent a message out to other tutors to see if they had experienced this before but with no luck. I also sent out a message on slack with the same result. **PLEASE NOTE:** This bug does **not** occur in the gitpod local preview of the site. There users can add posts, view profiles and add comments without fail. Both me and the tutor have checked among numerous other things that all the urls are correct and the config vars are correct. It is incredibly strange that this bug only appears in the deployed site. I have also made sure to commit, push and manually redeploy my site but no progress was made. No one can find out why the site works in the local preview but not on the deployed version. As far as I am aware there is nothing else I can possibly do to fix this bug, as we cannot even find the cause let alone suggest a solution. I have contacted Student Care reguarding this as I am very worried that I will fail the project because of this seemingly unfixable bug, however I doubt there is anything that anyone can even do to help. Even with extra time I don't see how I could fix this bug as I have already exhausted all options. The only thing I can think of would be to start again with a new repository, which would obviously require a very significant amount of time.

### Minor Bugs:

- Bug: The user could not see the stats on their profile/ another users profile such as number of posts, followers and following.

- Solution: In my serializers.py file inside the profiles directory I had forgotten to add 'posts_count', 'followers_count', 'following_count', to the fields lists in the meta class for the profile model.

![bug example 1](/docs/screenshots/fix1.jpg)


- Bug: The user could not view individual posts or comment on posts. They would just be taken to a blank white screen.

- Solution: Correct the import in PostPage.js. I was importing from "react-router" when it should have been "react-router-dom".

This file is a little strange as there is a lot of warnings here. Several of them are missing semi-colons, however I dont see how you can even add a semi-colon to line 12 for example. In the end I left this file as it was.

- I have tested my site using the devtools Lighthouse feature.

The results are not as good as I had hoped, with only 68 on performance due to a lot of images being loaded in the order they are posted by users.

## Deployment:

### Gitpod

- Typing 'python3 manage.py runserver' into the Gitpod terminal allows you to view a preview of the site in a browser.
- Dragging open the second terminal, type 'cd frontend' to ensure you in the frontend directory. Then type 'npm start' and click open preview to view the app.
- Every time a secton of code is added the browser can be refreshed to see the change, sometimes you need to press ctrl + shift + R for changes to be updated.
- To save and commit progress, type 'git add .' into the terminal to add all your changes followed by 'git commit -m' and then your message describing what you did in double quotes.
- Typing 'git push' will then push your code, and this should be done at the end of every coding session or whenever you want an already deployed site to be updated.


### ElephantSQL

- I used ElephantSQL to install and manage the database. I had already set up an account so I could log in and begin.
- I clicked on the green 'Create New Instance' button in the top right.
- I added details such as name, region and the type of plan I wanted which was the free 'Tiny Turtle' plan.
- My database url was then provided for me to copy and paste into my config vars on Heroku.


### Heroku

- For this project I deployed to Heroku at the begining of the project. Deploying early can save you a lot of time later on.
- To do this I created a new Heroku app which I also named sushicat.
- In the app settings I made sure to add all of the config vars I would need: the secret key, the port and my database url which I got from ElephantSQL.
- I made sure to comment out the old database 'db.sqlite3' in the settings.py file and added in my new database url.
- I also added my Heroku Hostname to the allowed hosts list.
- Back in Heroku I went to the deployment tab for my app and selected Github. Then I searched for and selected my repository.
- At the bottom of the page I ticked the box to enable automatic deploys, and then clicked deploy.
