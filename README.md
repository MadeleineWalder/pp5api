# Gamebook

Welcome to Gamebook! The site where gaming enthusiasts can share thoughts, tips, tricks and more about games!
This site is designed to be a social media platform aimed specifically at gamers. It is a place where the community can come together and share a huge amount of knowledge on any game.

## Technologies:

- This site was created using these languages: Python, JavaScript, HTML and CSS.
- Frameworks/Libraries: Django and Bootstrap.
- Allauth was used to create the log-in/out and sign-up forms.
- Github and Gitpod are the platforms where I created this website. Github (and Gihub pages) for creating and storing my repositories and project board/issues, and Gitpod for writing the code.
- Heroku for deployment.
- Unicorn Revealer is an extension for Chrome which I used to help me see the different elements of my site clearly.
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) is where I imported my fonts from.
- [Fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/) is the website where I sourced my social media icons.
- [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/) is the website I used to source the hero image.
- I used the website [amiresponsive.co.uk](https://amiresponsive.co.uk/) to show my finished site on different devices at the top of this page.

### Validator Testing

- I used the [W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input) to test my html.

The home page:
The results showed an error in two places where an anchor tag is wrapping the buttons. I did some research and I couldn't find out **why** this is bad practise. I even found one website which gave an example of some html where the button was wrapped in anchor tags. The website actually offers coding courses which I almost enrolled in myself. A link to the page is here: https://www.shecodes.io/athena/17038-how-to-add-a-link-to-my-button-in-html

The only other solution I could find was to remove the button tags and use divs instead, but style them like buttons. Unfortunately I dont think I will have time to implement this as I'm worried about the implications this will cause to the layout of my site so close to my deadline.

![The W3C Validator showing my HTML](/docs/screenshots/hpvalid1.jpg)

The menu page:
Here there were no errors.

![The W3C Validator showing my HTML](/docs/screenshots/bvalid.jpg)

The booking page:
I made sure to add a booking here before copying the source code so that could be tested too. I'm not sure what is going on with these errors. I have been looking over my code and all the errors say I have unclosed elements but all of mine are closed properly.
As an example the final error says that the main tag is unclosed, but you can clearly see that it is:

![The W3C Validator showing my HTML](/docs/screenshots/vbvalid.jpg)

![The W3C Validator showing my HTML](/docs/screenshots/main.jpg)

The Sign-up page:
No errors.

![The W3C Validator showing my HTML](/docs/screenshots/suvalid.jpg)

The Sign-in:

![The W3C Validator showing my HTML](/docs/screenshots/sivalid.jpg)

The Sign-out page:

![The W3C Validator showing my HTML](/docs/screenshots/sovalid.jpg)

- I used the [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input) to test my CSS. There were no errors:

![The W3C Validator showing my CSS](/docs/screenshots/cssvalid.jpg)

- I used the [CI Python Validator](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/) to test my python:

My models.py file had no errors:

![python validator testing my code](/docs/screenshots/models.jpg)

My forms.py file had no errors:

![python validator testing my code](/docs/screenshots/forms.jpg)

My views.py file had no errors:

![python validator testing my code](/docs/screenshots/views.jpg)

My urls.py files had no errors except one path which made the line too long:

![python validator testing my code](/docs/screenshots/urls1.jpg)

![python validator testing my code](/docs/screenshots/urls2.jpg)

I did not want to change this as I was worried it would effect the path.

My widgets.py file had no errors:

![python validator testing my code](/docs/screenshots/widgets.jpg)

My manage.py file had no errors:

![python validator testing my code](/docs/screenshots/manage.jpg)

My admin.py file had no errors:

![python validator testing my code](/docs/screenshots/admin.jpg)

My wsgi.py file had no errors:

![python validator testing my code](/docs/screenshots/wsgi.jpg)

My settings.py file had a few ling too long errors:

![python validator testing my code](/docs/screenshots/settings.jpg)

I could not fix these errors and code is still functioning as intended so I left them alone.
As you can see in this screenshot above, line 124, 127, 130 and 133 cannot be made shorter, at least to my knowledge.

- I used [JSHint](https://jshint.com/) to test my JavaScript:

![JSHint validator testing my code](/docs/screenshots/js.jpg)

As you can see the only errors were missing semi-colons so I added these.

![JSHint validator testing my code](/docs/screenshots/js1.jpg)

- I have tested my site using the devtools Lighthouse feature.

## Deployment:

### Gitpod

- Typing 'python3 manage.py runserver' into the Gitpod terminal allows you to view a preview of the site in a browser.
- Every time a secton of code is added the browser can be refreshed to see the change, sometimes you need to press ctrl + shift + R for changes to be updated.
- To save and commit progress, type 'git add .' into the terminal to add all your changes followed by 'git commit -m' and then your message describing what you did in double quotes.
- Typing 'git push' will then push your code, and this should be done at the end of every coding session or whenever you want an already deployed site to be updated.


### ElephantSQL

- I used ElephantSQL to install and manage the database. I had already set up an account so I could log in and begin.
- I clicked on the green 'Create New Instance' button in the top right.
- I added details such as name, region and the type of plan I wanted which was the free 'Tiny Turtle' plan.
- My database url was then provided for me to copy and use later on.


### Heroku

- For this project I deployed to Heroku at the begining of the project. Deploying early can save you a lot of time later on.
- To do this I created a new Heroku app which I also named sushicat.
- In the app settings I made sure to add all of the config vars I would need: the secret key, the port and my database url which I got from ElephantSQL.
- I made sure to comment out the old database 'db.sqlite3' in the settings.py file and added in my new database url.
- I also added my Heroku Hostname to the allowed hosts list.
- Back in Heroku I went to the deployment tab for my app and selected Github. Then I searched for and selected my repository.
- At the bottom of the page I ticked the box to enable automatic deploys, and the clicked deploy.
